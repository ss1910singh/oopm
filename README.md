# Marks_Exp1.java:- EXP1:-
The grading system describes how well students have achieved the learning
objectives or goals established for a class of course of study. This system helps to
categorize the students according to their grades. Design a system that reads marks
obtained by a student in a test of 100 marks and assign the grade as per the following
criteria.



# PrimeNumbers.java:- EXP2:-
Prime numbers are important because the security of many encryption
algorithms are based on the fact that it is very fast to multiply two large numbers and
get the result, while it is extremely computer-intensive to do the reverse. Enlist all the
prime numbers between 1 to 1000 to create a base for cryptography.



# Area_of_Rectangle_and_Square.java:- EXP3:-
The vendor provide a rubber material that provides the protection to the edges
of rectangular object and paper material for protection of front and back of
rectangular object. So a vendor needs a application to calculate the amount of rubber
and paper material required for covering rectangular object. Write area method for
calculating area of rectangle and square.(using class and object)



# Methodoverloading:- EXP4:-
School students need to study and learn formula for calculating area of different
shapes like circle, rectangle , triangle and square. Design an application which will
read require parameters for the area calculation of different shapes (use method
overloading)



# Passing_and_Returning.java:- EXP5:- 
An electrical engineer needs a complex number calculator for performing the
operation of addition of alternating current represented using complex number. Create
an application that takes two complex numbers as parameters and returns the resulting
complex number, which is the addition of two complex numbers.



# Array.java:- EXP6:- 
2D array is used in many real-life applications where we need to organize
data in tabular/matrix format. Hence a matrix manipulator is required with
functionality of reading, displaying and flipping data from the matrix. Generate
the methods, for the functionality mentioned above for creation the matrix
manipulator.



# Palindrome.java:- EXP7:- 
A character sequence is to be read as an input and result need to declare as
“yes” or “no” by investigating the fact that traversing the characters sequence
backwards and forwards results in same sequence. Write a program for the same using
StringBuffer.



# Inheritance.java:- EXP8:-  
Write a program to calculate volume of sphere using multilevel inheritance. The
base class method will accept the radius from user. A class will be derived from the
above-mentioned class that will have a method to find the area of a circle derived
from this will have method to calculate and display the volume of the sphere.


  
# Game.java:- EXP9:-
Consider a university where students who participate in the National Games or
Olympics are given some grace marks. The grace marks provided are fixed and same
for every student. Create an application that keeps student’s academic marks and
Sports grace marks separate and generate total of marks considering academics and
sports both. Also invoke methods of base class & interface using reference


  
# Exception_error.java:- EXP10:- 
Through Custom exception user can raise application-specific error code. You
are required to calculate a square of even number provided as input by user. However,
if a user provides an odd number as input, then an exception must be thrown explicitly
with message indicating the input number must be even number.



# Multithreading.java:- EXP11:-
Divide your program into two parts: One to read a number and the other to
calculate its square. Provide a simultaneous execution of both parts of a program to
maximum utilize the CPU time.



# Calculator.java:- EXP12:-
Create a GUI application which is fully equipped with the functionality of
solving various computation problems such as Addition, subtraction, Multiplication
and Division. The GUI application should runs in a browser and displays the output as
result of these mathematical operations.
